# BE-07: Documentation Improvements

## Description
Enhance our project documentation beyond Badge Engine's approach, focusing on comprehensive inline documentation, API documentation, and developer guides.

## Tasks
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all major functions, components, and types
- [ ] Create API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Write comprehensive README with project overview, setup instructions, and architecture
- [ ] Create developer guides for common tasks and workflows
- [ ] Document code organization and project structure
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Document database schema and relationships

## Implementation Details
Badge Engine has basic documentation, but we can improve with a more comprehensive approach:

### JSDoc Example
```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new badge in the system
 * 
 * @param {BadgeCreateInput} badgeData - The data for the new badge
 * @param {string} issuerId - The ID of the issuer creating the badge
 * @returns {Promise<Badge>} The newly created badge
 * @throws {Error} If the badge creation fails
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const newBadge = await createBadge({
 *   name: "Achievement Badge",
 *   description: "Awarded for completing the course",
 *   criteria: "Complete all modules with at least 80% score",
 * }, "issuer-123");
 * ```
 */
export async function createBadge(badgeData: BadgeCreateInput, issuerId: string): Promise<Badge> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### API Documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
```yaml
# swagger.yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Badges API
  description: API for managing digital badges and credentials
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /api/badges:
    get:
      summary: Get all badges
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A list of badges
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Badge'
    post:
      summary: Create a new badge
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/BadgeCreateInput'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: The created badge
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Badge'
```
