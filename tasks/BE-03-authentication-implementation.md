# BE-03: Authentication Implementation Improvements

## Description
Enhance our authentication system based on Badge Engine's clean implementation, focusing on better organization, type safety, and user experience.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review and refactor our current NextAuth implementation
- [ ] Implement proper session typing with TypeScript
- [ ] Add support for multiple authentication providers
- [ ] Create reusable authentication components
- [ ] Implement proper role-based access control
- [ ] Add session management utilities
- [ ] Document authentication flow and configuration

## Implementation Details
Badge Engine has a well-structured authentication setup with clear separation of concerns:

```typescript
// auth.ts
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  callbacks: {
    session: ({ session, user }) => ({
      ...session,
      user: {
        ...session.user,
        id: user.id,
      },
    }),
  },
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prismaConnect) as Adapter,
  providers: [
    Auth0Provider({
      clientId: env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: env.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,
      issuer: env.AUTH0_ISSUER,
    }),
    // Additional providers can be added here
  ],
};

// Type extensions for better type safety
declare module "next-auth" {
  interface Session extends DefaultSession {
    user: {
      id: string;
      role?: string;
    } & DefaultSession["user"];
  }
}
```

## Benefits
- Improved type safety
- Better separation of concerns
- More flexible authentication options
- Enhanced security
- Improved user experience
- Easier maintenance
