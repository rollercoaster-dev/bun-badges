# Task: Implement Log Sanitization & Address PR Feedback

**Goal:** Prevent sensitive information from being logged, address GitHub Advanced Security alerts, fix related test failures, and incorporate relevant feedback from PR #43.

## Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist
1.  **Sanitization Utility Created:**
    *   [`✅`] New file exists (`src/utils/sanitize.ts`).
    *   [`✅`] Defines functions/regex for redacting sensitive patterns.
    *   [`✅`] Handles recursive sanitization of objects/arrays.
    *   [`✅`] Unit tests exist and pass (`tests/unit/utils/sanitize.test.ts`).
2.  **Logger Integration & Refactoring:**
    *   [`✅`] `log` method in `src/utils/logger.ts` imports and uses the sanitizer.
    *   [`✅`] `message` and `args` are sanitized before JSON output.
    *   [`✅`] `message` and `args` are sanitized before pretty-print output.
    *   [`✅`] Logger correctly handles `NODE_ENV` and `LOG_LEVEL` dynamically.
    *   [`✅`] Logger outputs conditional JSON (production) / pretty-print (dev/test).
3.  **Specific Call Site Fixes:**
    *   [`✅`] Logging calls in `src/index.ts` modified to avoid logging sensitive TLS env vars directly.
4.  **Verification:**
    *   [`✅`] Logger unit tests verify redaction and core functionality (`tests/unit/utils/logger.test.ts`).
    *   [`✅`] Local testing confirmed redaction and test fixes.
    *   [`✅`] GitHub CI checks pass on PR #43 (Verified via `gh pr checks`).
    *   [`✅`] GitHub Advanced Security alerts resolved on PR #43 (Inferred from passing `CodeQL` check).
5.  **Documentation:**
    *   [`✅`] JSDoc comments explain the sanitizer utility.
    *   [`✅`] Comment in `logger.ts` indicates sanitization application.
    *   [`✅`] `README.md` updated with standard error response format.

## Current Implementation Status & Analysis
*   All identified issues (test failures, security alerts) related to logging have been addressed.
*   CI checks and CodeQL security scan are passing on the feature branch.
*   The custom logger remains, with the suggestion to potentially use Pino noted for future consideration if needed.
*   **This task is complete.**
*   **Relevant Files/Dirs:** `src/utils/sanitize.ts`, `src/utils/logger.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `tests/unit/utils/sanitize.test.ts`, `tests/unit/utils/logger.test.ts`, `README.md`.

---

## Gap Analysis (vs. Benchmark/Security Practice/Suggestions)
*   **(Resolved)** Previous gaps related to test failures and security alerts.
*   **(Acknowledged Suggestion/Future)** Copilot/Benchmark suggest using Pino for production logging. Current custom solution meets requirements but Pino could offer future benefits.

---

## Required Improvements / Actionable Tasks
*   None for this task. Ready to proceed to next phase review or merge PR.
