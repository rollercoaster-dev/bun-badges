# Task Status Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the current state of tasks in the project, identifies completed tasks, and provides a prioritized list of remaining tasks.

## Recently Completed Tasks
The following tasks have been completed and moved to the completed folder:

1. **Restore Test Database in Integration Tests** - Successfully restored proper test database connections in integration tests instead of using mocks.
2. **Fix Database Transactions** - Resolved issues with database transactions by simplifying the approach and using direct database operations.

## Task Status

### High Priority (In Progress)
1. **Fix Assertions Tests** - Tests failing with 404 errors, suggesting issues with route mounting or path configuration.
2. **Fix DB Integration Errors** - Critical for ensuring stable test environment.
3. **OB3 Compliance E2E Tests** - Important for ensuring compatibility with Open Badges 3.0 specification.
4. **Integration Test Overhaul** - Current status: 91% passing (56/62), need to fix remaining 6 failing assertion API tests.

### Medium Priority
1. **Test Refactoring** - Improve test organization and reduce duplication.
2. **Test DB Streamlining** - Optimize test database setup and teardown.
3. **Test Scripts Verification** - Ensure all test scripts are working correctly.
4. **Fix Explicit Any Types** - Improve type safety throughout the codebase.

### Roadmap/Planning Tasks
1. **OB3 Compliance Summary** - Overview of current Open Badges 3.0 compliance status.
2. **OB3 Research and Comparison** - Research on Open Badges 3.0 specification and comparison with current implementation.
3. **Open Badges Implementation Roadmap** - Long-term plan for Open Badges implementation.

### Missing Endpoints (To Implement)
1. **Missing Assertion Endpoints** - Implement missing assertion API endpoints.
2. **Missing Auth Endpoints** - Implement missing authentication endpoints.
3. **Missing Badge Endpoints** - Implement missing badge management endpoints.

## Progress Summary

- **Integration Tests**: 91% passing (56/62)
  - OAuth Controller: 100% passing (8/8)
  - Issuer Controller: 100% passing (16/16)
  - Verification Service: 100% passing (6/6)
  - Verification Edge Cases: 100% passing (7/7)
  - Assertions API: 0% passing (0/6)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix Assertions API Tests**
   - Investigate route mounting issues
   - Check URL path configurations
   - Verify API endpoint handlers

2. **Complete DB Integration Fixes**
   - Resolve remaining database interaction issues
   - Ensure consistent test data handling

3. **Implement OB3 Compliance Tests**
   - Set up structured end-to-end tests for OB3 compliance
   - Verify proper implementation of the OB3 specification

4. **Address Type Safety Issues**
   - Fix explicit any types to improve type safety
   - Ensure consistent type usage throughout the codebase

## Long-Term Planning
After addressing the immediate test and integration issues, focus should shift to:

1. **Implementing Missing Endpoints**
2. **Enhancing OB3 Specification Compliance**
3. **Improving Documentation**
4. **Refactoring Codebase for Maintainability**

## Final Recommendations
Prioritize fixing test infrastructure before moving on to feature development. A stable test environment is critical for ensuring reliable development and deployment.
