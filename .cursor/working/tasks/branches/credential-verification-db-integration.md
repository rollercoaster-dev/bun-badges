# Credential Verification with Database Integration

review .cursor/rules and all files

## Branch: `feat/credential-verification-db-integration`

### Current Status
- [x] Created database schema for credentials
- [x] Implemented credential signature verification
- [x] Added support for both JWT and Linked Data Signature formats
- [ ] Implemented recipient identifier validation with database checks
- [ ] Added credential status checking and revocation with database tracking
- [ ] Created database service methods for credential verification
- [ ] Written tests for credential verification service and API endpoints

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement credential verification service with database integration
   - Store and retrieve credentials from the database
   - Implement credential status checking with database queries
   - Add credential revocation with database tracking
2. Implement recipient identifier validation with database checks
3. Create database service methods for credential verification
4. Create API endpoints for credential verification and status checking
5. Write tests for credential verification service and API endpoints

### Learnings
- Credential verification requires both cryptographic validation and status checking
- Storing credential status in the database allows for revocation and suspension
- Supporting both JWT and Linked Data Signature formats provides flexibility
- Proper error handling for verification failures is important for security

### Next Steps
- Implement credential verification service with database integration
- Add recipient identifier validation with database checks
- Create database service methods for credential verification
- Create API endpoints for credential verification and status checking
