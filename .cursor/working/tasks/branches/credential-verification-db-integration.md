# Credential Verification with Database Integration

## Branch: `feat/credential-verification-db-integration`

## Prerequisites and Dependencies
- Database schema integration must be completed first
- PostgreSQL database must be running and accessible
- Environment variables for database connection must be configured
- Key management service must be implemented for signature verification

## Context and Background
Credential verification is a core component of the Open Badges 3.0 ecosystem, ensuring the authenticity and validity of badges. This feature implements database integration for credential verification, allowing for status checking, revocation, and recipient validation.

The Open Badges 3.0 specification requires support for both JWT and Linked Data Signatures, as well as mechanisms for checking credential status and validity. This implementation follows the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model and the Open Badges 3.0 specification.

Key design decisions:
- Support for both JWT and Linked Data Signature formats
- Database storage of credential status for revocation and suspension
- Recipient identifier validation with database checks
- Comprehensive error handling for verification failures

### Current Status
- [x] Created database schema for credentials
- [x] Implemented credential signature verification
- [x] Added support for both JWT and Linked Data Signature formats
- [x] Implemented recipient identifier validation with database checks
- [x] Added credential status checking and revocation with database tracking
- [x] Created database service methods for credential verification
- [x] Written tests for credential verification service and API endpoints

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement credential verification service with database integration
   - Store and retrieve credentials from the database
   - Implement credential status checking with database queries
   - Add credential revocation with database tracking
   - Handle both JWT and Linked Data Signature formats
2. Implement recipient identifier validation with database checks
   - Validate recipient identifiers against the database
   - Handle different identifier formats (email, URL, DID)
3. Create database service methods for credential verification
   - Check credential status (active, revoked, suspended)
   - Verify credential expiration and issuance dates
   - Validate credential issuer against trusted issuers
4. Create API endpoints for credential verification and status checking
5. Write tests for credential verification service and API endpoints

### Learnings
- Credential verification requires both cryptographic validation and status checking
- Storing credential status in the database allows for revocation and suspension
- Supporting both JWT and Linked Data Signature formats provides flexibility
- Proper error handling for verification failures is important for security

### Next Steps
- ✅ Implemented credential verification service with database integration
- ✅ Added recipient identifier validation with database checks
- ✅ Created database service methods for credential verification
- ✅ Created API endpoints for credential verification and status checking
- Consider adding more comprehensive tests for edge cases
- Consider adding performance optimizations for verification operations

### Related Code Sections
- `src/db/schema/credentials.schema.ts` - Database schema for credentials
- `src/services/credential-verification.service.ts` - Credential verification service
- `src/controllers/credential-verification.controller.ts` - API endpoints for verification
- `src/routes/credential-verification.routes.ts` - Routes for verification API

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for credential verification service methods
- Integration tests for database operations
- API tests for verification endpoints
- Security tests for signature verification

Test cases to cover:
1. JWT credential verification
2. Linked Data Signature verification
3. Credential status checking (active, revoked, suspended)
4. Recipient identifier validation
5. Error handling for invalid credentials
6. Performance testing for verification operations

### Rollback Plan
- Database migrations include down migrations for rollback
- API versioning allows for gradual deployment
- Verification service can fall back to cryptographic-only checks

### Definition of Done
- Credential verification with database integration is fully implemented
- Both JWT and Linked Data Signature formats are supported
- Credential status checking and revocation are implemented
- Recipient identifier validation is implemented
- All tests pass with good coverage
- Documentation is updated with verification details
- Performance meets requirements (verification completes in < 300ms)

## Completion Notes

This task has been completed and a pull request has been created: [PR #48](https://github.com/rollercoaster-dev/bun-badges/pull/48)

The implementation includes:
- A credential verification service with database integration
- Support for both JWT and Linked Data Signature formats
- Credential status checking and revocation with database tracking
- Recipient identifier validation with database checks
- API endpoints for verification and status checking
- Unit and integration tests for the new functionality

All TypeScript errors have been fixed and the code passes linting and formatting checks.
