# Phase 3 Security Implementation

## Branch: `feat/phase-3-security-implementation`

## 1. Goal and Context
- **Objective:** Implement the database schema foundation for Phase 3 security features
- **Energy Level:** High ðŸ”‹
- **Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

### Context and Background
This task focuses on implementing the database schema foundation for Phase 3 security features, which includes key management, OAuth 2.0 integration, authorization, and credential verification. The Open Badges 3.0 specification requires secure storage of keys, tokens, and credential status to ensure the integrity and security of the badge ecosystem.

These database schemas will provide the foundation for all security features in Phase 3. They enable the secure storage and management of cryptographic keys, OAuth tokens, and credential verification data, which are essential for implementing the security requirements of the Open Badges 3.0 specification.

The implementation follows database security best practices and provides a solid foundation for the other security features that will be built on top of it.

### Key Design Decisions
- Use of CUIDs for primary keys to prevent enumeration attacks and ensure global uniqueness
- Separation of concerns with distinct tables for keys, tokens, and credentials
- Inclusion of timestamps for creation, expiration, and revocation for audit purposes
- Storage of sensitive data with proper encryption and hashing
- Support for key rotation and versioning to maintain security over time

## 2. Resources and Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** 
  - PostgreSQL database must be running and accessible
  - Drizzle ORM must be installed and configured
  - Environment variables for database connection must be set
- **Existing Tools/Files:** 
  - Drizzle ORM for database schema definition and migrations
  - PostgreSQL for database storage
  - Existing schema files in `src/db/schema/`
- **Additional Needs:** 
  - Database migration tools
  - Testing environment for database operations

### Related Code Sections
- `src/db/schema/keys.schema.ts` - Schema for cryptographic keys
- `src/db/schema/tokens.schema.ts` - Schema for OAuth tokens
- `src/db/schema/credentials.schema.ts` - Schema for credential verification
- `src/db/schema/index.ts` - Main schema index file
- `src/db/migrate.ts` - Migration utility
- `drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle ORM configuration

## 3. Planning
### Current Status
- [x] Created database schema for keys (`src/db/schema/keys.schema.ts`)
- [x] Created database schema for tokens (`src/db/schema/tokens.schema.ts`)
- [x] Created database schema for credentials (`src/db/schema/credentials.schema.ts`)
- [x] Created task files for each feature branch
- [x] Updated Phase 3 task document with current progress
- [x] Integrated schemas with main schema index (exports added in `src/db/schema/index.ts`)
- [ ] Generated migrations using Drizzle Kit
- [ ] Applied migrations to development database
- [ ] Created basic database service methods for CRUD operations
- [ ] Written tests for database service methods

### Quick Wins
- [ ] Verify schema exports in main index file (5 mins)
- [ ] Check database connection configuration (5 mins)

### Implementation Plan
1. Generate Migrations - 30 mins ðŸŽ¯
   - Ensure database environment is properly configured
   - Generate migrations using Drizzle Kit
   - Review generated migration files
2. Apply Migrations - 20 mins ðŸŽ¯
   - Apply migrations to development database
   - Verify tables were created correctly
3. Implement Database Service Methods - 120 mins ðŸŽ¯
   - Create service files for keys, tokens, and credentials
   - Implement CRUD operations for each service
   - Integrate with existing authentication and authorization systems
4. Write Tests - 90 mins ðŸŽ¯
   - Create test files for each service
   - Write unit tests for service methods
   - Write integration tests for database operations

## 4. Technical Details
### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for service methods with mocked database operations
- Integration tests for actual database operations
- Schema validation tests to ensure proper table structure

Test cases to cover:
1. Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting keys
2. Key rotation and versioning
3. Token lifecycle management (creation, verification, revocation)
4. Credential verification and status checking
5. Error handling for invalid inputs and database errors

### Rollback Plan
- Database migrations include down migrations for rollback
- Schema changes are versioned for tracking
- Backup of database before applying migrations

### Definition of Done
- All schema files are created and properly exported
- Migrations are generated and can be applied successfully
- Database service methods are implemented and tested
- Unit and integration tests pass
- Documentation is updated with schema details
- Code review is completed and approved

## 5. Execution and Progress
### Progress Updates
- [x] Created schema files for keys, tokens, and credentials
- [x] Integrated schemas with main schema index
- [ ] Generated migrations using Drizzle Kit

### Context Resume Point
- Last working on: Updating the task file to match the new template
- Next planned action: Generate migrations for the new schemas
- Current blockers: None

### Next Actions & Blockers
- **Immediate Next Actions:** 
  - [ ] Generate migrations for the new schemas (30 mins)
  - [ ] Apply migrations to development database (20 mins)
- **Current Blockers:**
  - None currently identified

## 6. Reflection and Learning
### Decision Log
- **Decision:** Use CUIDs instead of UUIDs for primary keys
  - **Reasoning:** CUIDs provide better security against enumeration attacks and are more efficient in distributed systems
  - **Alternatives:** UUIDs were considered but have potential collision issues in high-volume distributed systems

- **Decision:** Separate schemas for keys, tokens, and credentials
  - **Reasoning:** Separation of concerns allows for more focused service implementations and better security isolation
  - **Alternatives:** A single security schema was considered but would have been too complex and violated single responsibility principle

### Learnings
- Drizzle ORM provides a type-safe way to define database schemas
- Proper schema design is critical for security features
- Separating concerns in database schemas leads to cleaner service implementations

### User Experience
- **Friction Points:** Understanding the existing migration system took some time
- **Flow Moments:** Creating the schema files was straightforward with Drizzle ORM
- **Celebration Notes:** ðŸŽ‰ Successfully integrated all schemas with the main schema index
