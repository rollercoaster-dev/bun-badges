# Authorization with Database Integration

review .cursor/rules and all files

## Branch: `feat/authorization-db-integration`

### Current Status
- [x] Created permission/role model
- [x] Implemented role-based access control middleware
- [x] Integrated authorization with protected routes
- [ ] Updated database schema to store user roles and permissions
- [ ] Implemented database service methods for role and permission management
- [ ] Added caching for frequently accessed permissions
- [ ] Written tests for authorization middleware and service

### Implementation Plan
1. Update database schema to store user roles and permissions
2. Implement database service methods for role and permission management
   - Assign roles to users
   - Check user permissions
   - Manage roles and permissions
3. Add caching for frequently accessed permissions
4. Update authorization middleware to use database service
5. Write tests for authorization middleware and service

### Learnings
- Role-based access control provides a flexible and scalable approach to authorization
- Storing roles and permissions in the database allows for dynamic updates without code changes
- Caching frequently accessed permissions improves performance
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access is critical for security

### Next Steps
- Update database schema to store user roles and permissions
- Implement database service methods for role and permission management
- Add caching for frequently accessed permissions
- Update authorization middleware to use database service
