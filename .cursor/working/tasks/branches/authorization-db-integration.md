# Authorization with Database Integration

## Branch: `feat/authorization-db-integration`

## Prerequisites and Dependencies
- Database schema integration must be completed first
- PostgreSQL database must be running and accessible
- Environment variables for database connection must be configured
- Role-based access control middleware must be implemented

## Context and Background
Authorization is a critical security component that controls what actions users can perform within the application. This feature implements database storage for user roles and permissions, allowing for dynamic updates without code changes.

The Open Badges 3.0 specification requires proper authorization controls to protect sensitive operations like issuing badges, managing keys, and accessing user data. This implementation follows security best practices from OWASP for role-based access control.

Key design decisions:
- Roles and permissions are stored in the database for dynamic management
- Caching is used to improve performance for frequently accessed permissions
- Middleware-based approach for consistent authorization across routes
- Support for hierarchical roles with permission inheritance

### Current Status
- [x] Created permission/role model (in `src/models/auth/roles.ts`)
- [x] Implemented role-based access control middleware (in `src/middleware/authorization.middleware.ts`)
- [x] Integrated authorization with protected routes
- [ ] Updated database schema to store user roles and permissions
- [ ] Implemented database service methods for role and permission management
- [ ] Added caching for frequently accessed permissions
- [ ] Written tests for authorization middleware and service

### Implementation Plan
1. Update database schema to store user roles and permissions
   - Create tables for roles, permissions, and user-role assignments
   - Add relationships between users, roles, and permissions
   - Create a migration file for the new schema
2. Implement database service methods for role and permission management
   - Create an authorization service with methods to:
     - Assign roles to users
     - Check user permissions
     - Manage roles and permissions
3. Add caching for frequently accessed permissions
   - Implement cache invalidation on role/permission changes
   - Configure cache TTL for optimal performance
4. Update authorization middleware to use database service
   - Modify the existing middleware to fetch roles and permissions from the database
5. Write tests for authorization middleware and service

### Learnings
- Role-based access control provides a flexible and scalable approach to authorization
- Storing roles and permissions in the database allows for dynamic updates without code changes
- Caching frequently accessed permissions improves performance
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access is critical for security

### Next Steps
- Update database schema to store user roles and permissions
- Implement database service methods for role and permission management
- Add caching for frequently accessed permissions
- Update authorization middleware to use database service

### Related Code Sections
- `src/models/auth/roles.ts` - Existing role and permission definitions
- `src/middleware/authorization.middleware.ts` - Existing authorization middleware
- `src/db/schema/` - Database schema directory (need to add roles schema)
- `src/services/` - Services directory (need to create authorization service)
- `src/routes/` - Protected routes using authorization

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for authorization service methods
- Integration tests for database operations
- API tests for protected endpoints
- Performance tests for caching effectiveness

Test cases to cover:
1. Role assignment and permission checking
2. Cache performance and invalidation
3. Authorization middleware with different roles
4. Error handling for unauthorized access
5. Dynamic role and permission updates

### Rollback Plan
- Database migrations include down migrations for rollback
- Authorization middleware can fall back to in-memory role checking
- API versioning allows for gradual deployment

### Definition of Done
- All authorization operations are implemented with database integration
- Caching is properly implemented for frequently accessed permissions
- Authorization middleware uses the database service for permission checks
- All tests pass with good coverage
- Documentation is updated with authorization details
- Performance meets requirements (permission checks complete in < 50ms)
