# Database Schema Integration for Security Features

review .cursor/rules and all files

## Branch: `feat/db-schema-integration`

### Current Status
- [x] Created database schema for keys
- [x] Created database schema for tokens
- [x] Created database schema for credentials
- [ ] Added schemas to main schema index
- [ ] Generated and applied migrations
- [ ] Created database service methods for basic CRUD operations

### Implementation Plan
1. Create database schemas for security features
   - Keys schema for secure key management
   - Tokens schema for OAuth token management
   - Credentials schema for credential verification and status
2. Add schemas to main schema index
3. Generate and apply migrations
4. Create database service methods for basic CRUD operations
5. Write tests for database service methods

### Learnings
- Database schema design for security features requires careful consideration of relationships between entities
- Encryption of sensitive data (like private keys) should be handled at the application level before storing in the database
- Using CUID for primary keys provides better security and performance than sequential IDs
- Including timestamps for creation, expiration, and revocation helps with auditing and security management

### Next Steps
- Complete the integration of schemas with the main schema index
- Generate and apply migrations
- Create database service methods for basic CRUD operations
- Write tests for database service methods
