# Security Headers and Protections

review .cursor/rules and all files

## Branch: `feat/security-headers`

### Current Status
- [x] Configured CORS for the application
- [ ] Implemented Content Security Policy
- [ ] Added XSS protection mechanisms
- [ ] Implemented CSRF protection for relevant endpoints
- [ ] Added rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
- [ ] Implemented CLR Standard API Security requirements
- [ ] Written tests for security headers and protections

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement Content Security Policy
   - Configure CSP headers for the application
   - Test CSP configuration with security tools
2. Add XSS protection mechanisms
   - Implement input sanitization
   - Configure XSS protection headers
3. Implement CSRF protection for relevant endpoints
   - Add CSRF token generation and validation
   - Apply CSRF protection to relevant endpoints
4. Add rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
   - Implement rate limiting middleware
   - Configure rate limits for different endpoints
5. Implement CLR Standard API Security requirements
6. Write tests for security headers and protections

### Learnings
- Security headers provide an additional layer of protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Content Security Policy helps prevent XSS attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded
- CSRF protection is important for endpoints that modify data
- Rate limiting helps prevent abuse and denial of service attacks

### Next Steps
- Implement Content Security Policy
- Add XSS protection mechanisms
- Implement CSRF protection for relevant endpoints
- Add rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
