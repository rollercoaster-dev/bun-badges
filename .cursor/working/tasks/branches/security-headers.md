# Security Headers and Protections

## Branch: `feat/security-headers`

## Prerequisites and Dependencies
- Express.js application must be set up
- Middleware support must be available
- Environment variables for security configuration must be set

## Context and Background
Security headers and protections are essential for defending web applications against common vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking. This feature implements a comprehensive set of security headers and protections to enhance the security posture of the Open Badges 3.0 implementation.

The implementation follows OWASP security best practices and industry standards for web application security. It includes Content Security Policy, XSS protection, CSRF protection, and rate limiting mechanisms.

Key design decisions:
- Security headers are configured globally for all routes
- Content Security Policy is tailored to the application's needs
- CSRF protection is applied to all state-changing endpoints
- Rate limiting is configured based on endpoint sensitivity

### Current Status
- [x] Configured CORS for the application
- [ ] Implemented Content Security Policy
- [ ] Added XSS protection mechanisms
- [ ] Implemented CSRF protection for relevant endpoints
- [ ] Added rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
- [ ] Implemented CLR Standard API Security requirements
- [ ] Written tests for security headers and protections

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement Content Security Policy
   - Configure CSP headers for the application
   - Define allowed sources for scripts, styles, and other resources
   - Implement reporting for CSP violations
   - Test CSP configuration with security tools
2. Add XSS protection mechanisms
   - Implement input sanitization for user-provided content
   - Configure XSS protection headers
   - Add output encoding for dynamic content
3. Implement CSRF protection for relevant endpoints
   - Add CSRF token generation and validation
   - Apply CSRF protection to all state-changing endpoints
   - Implement secure cookie handling
4. Add rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
   - Implement rate limiting middleware
   - Configure rate limits based on endpoint sensitivity
   - Add IP-based and token-based rate limiting
5. Implement CLR Standard API Security requirements
   - Add security headers required by CLR standards
   - Implement secure error handling
   - Add logging for security events
6. Write tests for security headers and protections

### Learnings
- Security headers provide an additional layer of protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Content Security Policy helps prevent XSS attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded
- CSRF protection is important for endpoints that modify data
- Rate limiting helps prevent abuse and denial of service attacks

### Next Steps
- Implement Content Security Policy
- Add XSS protection mechanisms
- Implement CSRF protection for relevant endpoints
- Add rate limiting and throttling mechanisms

### Related Code Sections
- `src/middleware/security.middleware.ts` - Security middleware implementation
- `src/config/security.config.ts` - Security configuration
- `src/app.ts` - Application setup with security middleware
- `src/routes/` - Routes with CSRF protection

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for security middleware
- Integration tests for security headers
- Security scanning with tools like OWASP ZAP
- Manual testing with browser developer tools

Test cases to cover:
1. Content Security Policy enforcement
2. XSS protection effectiveness
3. CSRF protection for state-changing endpoints
4. Rate limiting under load
5. Security headers presence and configuration

### Rollback Plan
- Security middleware can be disabled or reconfigured easily
- CSP can be set to report-only mode for testing
- Rate limiting thresholds can be adjusted based on performance impact

### Definition of Done
- All security headers are properly configured and tested
- Content Security Policy is implemented and enforced
- XSS protection mechanisms are in place
- CSRF protection is applied to all state-changing endpoints
- Rate limiting is configured and tested
- All tests pass with good coverage
- Security scanning shows no critical vulnerabilities
- Documentation is updated with security details
