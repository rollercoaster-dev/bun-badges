# OAuth 2.0 with Database Integration

review .cursor/rules and all files

## Branch: `feat/oauth2-db-integration`

### Current Status
- [x] Created database schema for tokens
- [x] Implemented OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow
- [x] Added dynamic client registration with database storage
- [ ] Implemented token storage, refresh, and revocation with database tracking
- [ ] Added proper scope handling for different operations
- [ ] Created database service methods for OAuth operations
- [ ] Written tests for OAuth service and API endpoints

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement OAuth service with database integration
   - Store and retrieve clients from the database
   - Store and retrieve tokens from the database
   - Implement token refresh with database tracking
   - Implement token revocation with database tracking
2. Add dynamic client registration with database storage
3. Implement proper scope handling for different operations
4. Create database service methods for OAuth operations
5. Write tests for OAuth service and API endpoints

### Learnings
- OAuth 2.0 implementation requires careful consideration of token lifecycle
- Token storage should include hashing for security
- Token revocation should be tracked in the database for proper validation
- Scope handling is critical for proper authorization

### Next Steps
- ✅ Database schema for tokens - Completed
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow - Completed
- ✅ Dynamic client registration with database storage - Completed
- Implement token storage, refresh, and revocation with database tracking
- Add proper scope handling for different operations
- Create database service methods for OAuth operations
- Write tests for OAuth service and API endpoints
- Update documentation with OAuth details

### Related Code Sections
- `src/db/schema/tokens.schema.ts` - Database schema for tokens
- `src/services/oauth.service.ts` - OAuth service implementation
- `src/controllers/oauth.controller.ts` - OAuth controller implementation
- `src/routes/oauth.routes.ts` - OAuth routes definition

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for OAuth service methods
- Integration tests for database operations
- API tests for OAuth endpoints
- Security tests for token validation and revocation

Test cases to cover:
1. Authorization Code Grant flow
2. Token refresh and validation
3. Token revocation
4. Dynamic client registration
5. Scope validation
6. Error handling for invalid requests

### Rollback Plan
- Database migrations include down migrations for rollback
- API versioning allows for gradual deployment
- Backward compatibility with existing tokens

### Definition of Done
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow is implemented
- ✅ Dynamic client registration is implemented with database storage
- [ ] Token storage, refresh, and revocation are implemented with database tracking
- [ ] Proper scope handling is implemented for different operations
- [ ] Database service methods for OAuth operations are implemented
- [ ] Tests for OAuth service and API endpoints are written and passing
- [ ] All tests pass with good coverage
- [ ] Documentation is updated with OAuth details
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (token operations complete in < 200ms)
