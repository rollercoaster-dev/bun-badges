# Key Management with Database Integration

## Branch: `feat/key-management-db-integration`

## Prerequisites and Dependencies
- Database schema integration must be completed first
- PostgreSQL database must be running and accessible
- Environment variables for database connection must be configured
- Node.js crypto module or similar cryptography library must be available

## Context and Background
Secure key management is a critical component of the Open Badges 3.0 implementation. It enables the secure signing and verification of credentials, which is essential for the trust model of Open Badges. This feature implements database storage for cryptographic keys with proper encryption, rotation, and revocation capabilities.

The Open Badges 3.0 specification requires support for both JWT and Linked Data Signatures, which necessitates a flexible key management system that can handle different key types and algorithms. The implementation follows security best practices from NIST and OWASP for key management.

Key design decisions:
- Keys are stored in the database with encrypted private keys
- Key rotation maintains links to previous keys for verification of older credentials
- Access to key management is restricted to administrators only
- Support for multiple key types and algorithms is provided

### Current Status
- [x] Created database schema for keys
- [ ] Implemented key management service with database integration
- [ ] Added encryption for private keys
- [ ] Implemented key rotation with database tracking
- [ ] Implemented key revocation with database tracking
- [ ] Created API endpoints for key management
- [ ] Added role-based access control for key management
- [ ] Written tests for key management service

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement key management service with database integration
   - Create, read, update, and delete keys in the database
   - Add encryption for private keys
   - Implement key rotation with database tracking
   - Implement key revocation with database tracking
2. Create API endpoints for key management
   - Get all keys (admin only)
   - Get a key by ID (admin only)
   - Create a new key (admin only)
   - Rotate a key (admin only)
   - Revoke a key (admin only)
3. Add role-based access control for key management
4. Write tests for key management service and API endpoints

### Learnings
- Secure key management is critical for Open Badges 3.0 implementation
- Private keys should be encrypted before storing in the database
- Key rotation should maintain a link to the previous key for verification of older credentials
- Access to key management should be restricted to administrators only

### Next Steps
- Implement key management service with database integration
- Add encryption for private keys
- Implement key rotation with database tracking
- Create API endpoints for key management

### Related Code Sections
- `src/db/schema/keys.schema.ts` - Database schema for keys
- `src/services/key-management.service.ts` - Current key management service implementation
- `src/controllers/key-management.controller.ts` - API endpoints for key management
- `src/routes/key-management.routes.ts` - Routes for key management API

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for key management service methods
- Integration tests for database operations
- API tests for key management endpoints
- Security tests for key encryption and protection

Test cases to cover:
1. Key generation with different algorithms
2. Key rotation and maintaining links to previous keys
3. Key revocation and status checking
4. Access control for key management operations
5. Error handling for invalid keys or operations

### Rollback Plan
- Database migrations include down migrations for rollback
- Key rotation maintains previous keys for rollback
- API versioning allows for gradual deployment

### Definition of Done
- All key management operations are implemented with database integration
- Private keys are properly encrypted in the database
- Key rotation and revocation are fully functional
- All tests pass with good coverage
- API endpoints are properly secured with role-based access control
- Documentation is updated with key management details
- Performance meets requirements (key operations complete in < 500ms)
