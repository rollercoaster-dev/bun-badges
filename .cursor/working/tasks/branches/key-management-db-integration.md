# Key Management with Database Integration

## Branch: `feat/key-management-db-integration`

### Current Status
- [x] Created database schema for keys
- [ ] Implemented key management service with database integration
- [ ] Added encryption for private keys
- [ ] Implemented key rotation with database tracking
- [ ] Implemented key revocation with database tracking
- [ ] Created API endpoints for key management
- [ ] Added role-based access control for key management
- [ ] Written tests for key management service

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement key management service with database integration
   - Create, read, update, and delete keys in the database
   - Add encryption for private keys
   - Implement key rotation with database tracking
   - Implement key revocation with database tracking
2. Create API endpoints for key management
   - Get all keys (admin only)
   - Get a key by ID (admin only)
   - Create a new key (admin only)
   - Rotate a key (admin only)
   - Revoke a key (admin only)
3. Add role-based access control for key management
4. Write tests for key management service and API endpoints

### Learnings
- Secure key management is critical for Open Badges 3.0 implementation
- Private keys should be encrypted before storing in the database
- Key rotation should maintain a link to the previous key for verification of older credentials
- Access to key management should be restricted to administrators only

### Next Steps
- Implement key management service with database integration
- Add encryption for private keys
- Implement key rotation with database tracking
- Create API endpoints for key management
