# Current Branch Plan: feat/phase-3-security-implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for our current branch `feat/phase-3-security-implementation`, which serves as the foundation for Phase 3 security implementation. We'll complete the database schema integration in this branch before creating specific feature branches for detailed implementations.

## Current Status
- [x] Created database schema for keys
- [x] Created database schema for tokens
- [x] Created database schema for credentials
- [x] Created task files for each feature branch
- [x] Updated Phase 3 task document with current progress
- [ ] Integrated schemas with main schema index
- [ ] Generated and applied migrations
- [ ] Created basic database service methods

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Complete Database Schema Integration
- [x] Create database schema for keys
- [x] Create database schema for tokens
- [x] Create database schema for credentials
- [ ] Add schemas to main schema index
- [ ] Generate migrations using Drizzle Kit
- [ ] Apply migrations to development database
- [ ] Create basic database service methods for CRUD operations
- [ ] Write tests for database service methods

### 2. Create Feature Branches
Once the database schema integration is complete, we'll create the following feature branches from this branch:
- `feat/key-management-db-integration`
- `feat/oauth2-db-integration`
- `feat/authorization-db-integration`
- `feat/credential-verification-db-integration`
- `feat/security-headers`

### 3. Implement Features in Separate Branches
Each feature branch will focus on implementing one aspect of the security features:
- Key management with database integration
- OAuth 2.0 with database integration
- Authorization with database integration
- Credential verification with database integration
- Security headers and protections

### 4. Merge Feature Branches
As each feature is completed:
- Create pull requests to merge feature branches back to main
- Update the Phase 3 task document with progress
- Document implementation details in the README

## Next Steps
1. Complete the integration of schemas with the main schema index
2. Generate and apply migrations
3. Create basic database service methods
4. Create the first feature branch for key management

## Commit Structure
- `feat(db): integrate security database schemas with migrations`
- `feat(db): add basic database service methods for security features`
- `test(db): add tests for security database services`
- `docs: update documentation for database schema integration`
