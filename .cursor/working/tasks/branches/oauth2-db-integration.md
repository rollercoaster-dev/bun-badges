# OAuth 2.0 with Database Integration

## Branch: `feat/oauth2-db-integration`

### Current Status
- [x] Created database schema for tokens
- [x] Implemented OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow
- [ ] Added dynamic client registration with database storage
- [ ] Implemented token storage, refresh, and revocation with database tracking
- [ ] Added proper scope handling for different operations
- [ ] Created database service methods for OAuth operations
- [ ] Written tests for OAuth service and API endpoints

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement OAuth service with database integration
   - Store and retrieve clients from the database
   - Store and retrieve tokens from the database
   - Implement token refresh with database tracking
   - Implement token revocation with database tracking
2. Add dynamic client registration with database storage
3. Implement proper scope handling for different operations
4. Create database service methods for OAuth operations
5. Write tests for OAuth service and API endpoints

### Learnings
- OAuth 2.0 implementation requires careful consideration of token lifecycle
- Token storage should include hashing for security
- Token revocation should be tracked in the database for proper validation
- Scope handling is critical for proper authorization

### Next Steps
- Implement OAuth service with database integration
- Add dynamic client registration with database storage
- Implement token storage, refresh, and revocation with database tracking
- Create database service methods for OAuth operations
