# BE-10: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Description
Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that goes beyond what Badge Engine might have, focusing on automated testing, deployment, and quality checks.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD platform
- [ ] Implement automated testing in the pipeline
- [ ] Add code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- [ ] Configure build and deployment processes
- [ ] Implement environment-specific deployments
- [ ] Add security scanning
- [ ] Configure performance testing
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

## Implementation Details
We can implement a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install
      - name: Lint
        run: bun run lint
      - name: Type check
        run: bun run typecheck

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install
      - name: Run tests
        run: bun test
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [lint, test]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install
      - name: Build
        run: bun run build
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build
          path: .next

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build
          path: .next
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deployment steps here
```

## Benefits
- Automated testing and quality checks
- Consistent build and deployment process
- Early detection of issues
- Improved code quality
