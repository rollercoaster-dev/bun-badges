# Task: Implement openbadges-types Package

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:** Add the openbadges-types package and create a plan for gradual adoption
- **Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Not Started
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

## 2. Resources
- **Package:** [openbadges-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openbadges-types)
- **Existing Types:** `src/models/credential.model.ts`, `src/models/issuer.model.ts`

## 3. Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Initial Setup
- [x] Install openbadges-types package
- [x] Create a simple adapter module that re-exports types
- [x] Document the available types and their usage

### 3.2 Documentation and Analysis
- [x] Create a mapping document between our custom types and openbadges-types
- [x] Identify potential compatibility issues (branded types, etc.)
- [x] Document strategies for gradual migration

### 3.3 Create Helper Functions
- [x] Create utility functions for working with branded types (IRI, DateTime)
- [x] Add type conversion functions for existing code
- [x] Write examples of proper usage

### 3.4 Implement in New Code
- [ ] Use openbadges-types in new features first
- [ ] Create guidelines for developers on when to use which types
- [ ] Add examples to documentation

## 4. Migration Strategy

Rather than replacing all existing types at once, we'll take a gradual approach:

1. **Phase 1: Parallel Types**
   - Keep existing types working as-is
   - Add openbadges-types package
   - Create adapter/utility functions
   - Document the new types

2. **Phase 2: New Code Uses New Types**
   - All new features use openbadges-types
   - Existing code continues to use current types
   - Add conversion functions between type systems

3. **Phase 3: Gradual Migration**
   - Incrementally update modules to use openbadges-types
   - Start with less connected modules
   - Add tests for each migrated module

4. **Phase 4: Complete Migration**
   - Remove duplicate type definitions
   - Update all documentation
   - Ensure full test coverage

## 5. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Branded types causing type errors
  - **Mitigation:** Create helper functions for type conversion
- **Risk:** Breaking changes in existing code
  - **Mitigation:** Gradual migration with thorough testing
- **Risk:** Inconsistent type usage across codebase
  - **Mitigation:** Clear documentation and guidelines

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- [x] openbadges-types package is installed
- [x] Adapter module and helper functions are created
- [x] Documentation for gradual migration is complete
- [x] Example usage is provided
- [x] No breaking changes to existing code
