# Database, Testing, and CI Pipeline Improvements

## Database Configuration and Management

- [ ] **Create a dedicated database setup script for CI**
  - Create a script that properly initializes all required tables for tests
  - Ensure it handles both fresh installs and updates to existing databases
  - Add proper error handling for common database connection issues

- [ ] **Implement database migrations versioning**
  - Add a version tracking table to track applied migrations
  - Implement a system to only run new migrations
  - Add rollback capability for failed migrations

- [ ] **Improve environment variable handling**
  - Create a centralized config module that validates all required environment variables
  - Add sensible defaults for development environments
  - Add validation for required variables in production environments

- [ ] **Add database connection pooling configuration**
  - Configure proper connection pool sizes based on environment
  - Add connection timeout and retry logic
  - Implement graceful shutdown of database connections

## Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] **Separate test database setup from application code**
  - Create dedicated test fixtures for database setup
  - Implement proper test data seeding
  - Add cleanup routines that run after tests

- [ ] **Implement test isolation**
  - Ensure each test runs in isolation with its own data
  - Use transactions to roll back changes after each test
  - Prevent test pollution between test suites

- [ ] **Add test categorization**
  - Clearly separate unit, integration, and e2e tests
  - Add ability to run specific test categories
  - Implement test tagging for selective test runs

- [ ] **Improve test coverage**
  - Add code coverage reporting to CI
  - Set minimum coverage thresholds
  - Focus on critical paths and error handling

## CI Pipeline Enhancements

- [ ] **Implement CI caching**
  - Cache node_modules to speed up builds
  - Cache test databases between runs when possible
  - Implement intelligent cache invalidation

- [ ] **Add parallel test execution**
  - Configure tests to run in parallel when possible
  - Split test suites into balanced groups
  - Add proper resource allocation for parallel jobs

- [ ] **Implement staged deployments**
  - Add staging environment deployment after successful tests
  - Implement smoke tests against staging environment
  - Add manual approval step before production deployment

- [ ] **Enhance CI reporting**
  - Add test result reporting with trends over time
  - Implement failure analysis to identify flaky tests
  - Add performance monitoring for test execution time

## Error Handling and Logging

- [ ] **Improve error handling**
  - Standardize error handling across the application
  - Add proper error classification (operational vs. programmer errors)
  - Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures

- [ ] **Enhance logging**
  - Add structured logging with proper context
  - Implement log levels appropriate for each environment
  - Add request ID tracking across services

- [ ] **Add monitoring and alerting**
  - Implement health checks for critical services
  - Add performance monitoring
  - Set up alerts for critical failures

## Security Enhancements

- [ ] **Implement secrets management**
  - Move sensitive data to a secrets manager
  - Rotate credentials regularly
  - Implement least privilege access

- [ ] **Add security scanning**
  - Implement dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Add static code analysis for security issues
  - Implement container scanning for Docker images

## Documentation

- [ ] **Improve developer documentation**
  - Document local development setup
  - Add clear instructions for running tests
  - Document CI/CD pipeline and deployment process

- [ ] **Create architecture documentation**
  - Document database schema and relationships
  - Add service architecture diagrams
  - Document integration points and APIs
