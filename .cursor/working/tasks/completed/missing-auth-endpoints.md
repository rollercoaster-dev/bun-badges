# Missing Authentication Endpoints

## Issues

Tests show that the authentication endpoints expected by our E2E test suite are not implemented in the real application:

- POST /auth/register returns 404
- The registration process expects a 201 status and a response body with an id field

## Required Implementation

1. Create or update the authentication router to handle:
   - POST /auth/register - For user registration
   - POST /auth/login - For user authentication

2. Ensure responses match expected formats:
   - Registration should return status 201 with a JSON body including the user id
   - Login should return status 200 with a token and user data

## Acceptance Criteria

- E2E tests for authentication pass when running with real endpoints
- Proper validation and error handling is implemented
- Database integration works correctly for storing user information
