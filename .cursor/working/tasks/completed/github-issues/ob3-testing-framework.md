# OB3 Testing Framework

## Priority
High

## Status
In Progress

## Parent Issue
OB3 Implementation Roadmap

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing for the Open Badges 3.0 implementation, including integration tests, compliance verification, and validation against official examples.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create integration tests for complete OB3 workflows
  - [ ] Test credential issuance with different recipient types
  - [ ] Test verification with valid and invalid credentials
  - [ ] Test revocation flows and status list updates
  - [ ] Test format conversion between OB2 and OB3

- [ ] Implement schema validation tests
  - [ ] Validate against official IMS Global schemas
  - [ ] Test with both valid and invalid credential structures
  - [ ] Verify required fields and constraints
  - [ ] Test JSON-LD context validation

- [ ] Add cryptographic proof validation tests
  - [ ] Test signature verification with valid keys
  - [ ] Test detection of tampered credentials
  - [ ] Test handling of invalid signatures
  - [ ] Test different key formats

- [ ] Create status list functionality tests
  - [ ] Test status list creation and management
  - [ ] Test credential revocation process
  - [ ] Test status checking with revoked and valid credentials
  - [ ] Test BitSet implementation

- [ ] Implement compliance testing against official examples
  - [ ] Test against official IMS Global examples
  - [ ] Create conformance test suite
  - [ ] Document compatibility with official standards
  - [ ] Generate compliance report

## Technical Considerations
- Integration tests should use an isolated test database
- Tests should cover both API endpoints and internal service functions
- Consider running OB3 tests separately from general test suite due to complexity
- May need to mock external context files for reliable testing

## Estimated Effort
8-12 hours

## Success Criteria
- All new OB3 tests pass consistently
- At least 80% code coverage for OB3-specific components
- Verified compatibility with official IMS Global standards
- Detailed test reports documenting compliance
