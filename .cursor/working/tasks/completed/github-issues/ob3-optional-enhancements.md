# OB3 Optional Enhancements

## Priority
Low

## Status
Pending

## Parent Issue
OB3 Implementation Roadmap

## Description
Implement optional enhancements to the Open Badges 3.0 implementation to improve flexibility, security, and standards compliance. These enhancements are not critical for basic OB3 functionality but would improve the robustness and capabilities of the implementation.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement additional cryptographic suites beyond Ed25519
  - [ ] Add support for JsonWebSignature2020
  - [ ] Implement P-256 key support
  - [ ] Add RSA signature capabilities
  - [ ] Enable dynamic selection of cryptographic suites

- [ ] Add support for selective disclosure
  - [ ] Implement Merkle tree-based selective disclosure
  - [ ] Add BBS+ signatures support
  - [ ] Create API for requesting partial credential disclosure
  - [ ] Add documentation for selective disclosure features

- [ ] Enhance canonicalization for JSON-LD signatures
  - [ ] Implement URDNA2015 canonicalization
  - [ ] Improve JSON-LD processing
  - [ ] Add support for JSON-LD framing
  - [ ] Ensure full compatibility with W3C standards

- [ ] Implement advanced privacy features
  - [ ] Add support for zero-knowledge proofs
  - [ ] Implement more secure hashing options
  - [ ] Add advanced identity protection methods
  - [ ] Create privacy-preserving verification options

## Technical Considerations
- Additional cryptographic libraries may be required
- Some features may have significant performance implications
- Advanced standards compliance may require extensive JSON-LD handling
- Consider backward compatibility with existing verification systems

## Implementation Approach
1. Research each enhancement area to determine implementation requirements
2. Prioritize based on user needs and implementation complexity
3. Implement with appropriate unit tests and documentation
4. Ensure backward compatibility with current OB3 implementation

## Estimated Effort
12-20 hours (full implementation of all enhancements)

## Success Criteria
- All implemented enhancements function correctly
- Backward compatibility is maintained
- Performance remains acceptable
- Implementation follows W3C and IMS Global standards
