OB3 Implementation Roadmap

## Description
This document lists all the completed items for the Open Badges 3.0 implementation. These features have been successfully implemented and are working in the current codebase.

## Completed Items

### 1. Data Models and Schema ✅
- [x] Enhanced credential models for Open Badges 3.0 in `src/models/credential.model.ts`
- [x] Added full type definitions for Verifiable Credentials data model
- [x] Implemented credential subject variations (EmailCredentialSubject, DidCredentialSubject, etc.)
- [x] Added status list credential types following the W3C StatusList2021 specification
- [x] Implemented proper JSON-LD context handling with context constants

### 2. Credential Generation ✅
- [x] Implemented OB3 credential creation in `src/controllers/assertions.controller.ts`
- [x] Added support for cryptographic signing with Ed25519 keys
- [x] Implemented proper context inclusion with W3C VC and OB3 contexts
- [x] Added credential schema references to IMS Global schemas
- [x] Created key generation utilities in `src/utils/signing/key-generation.ts`

### 3. Verification System ✅
- [x] Implemented cryptographic verification in `src/services/verification.service.ts`
- [x] Added support for signature validation with different key types
- [x] Created schema validation utilities in `src/utils/schema-validation.ts`
- [x] Implemented detailed verification results with specific error reporting
- [x] Added tamper detection for credential integrity

### 4. Status List Implementation ✅
- [x] Implemented BitSet for status tracking in `src/utils/signing/status-list.ts`
- [x] Created status list credential generation following W3C StatusList2021
- [x] Added UUID to index mapping for efficient status lookups
- [x] Implemented revocation mechanism via status lists
- [x] Created status update utilities for credential revocation

### 5. API Endpoints ✅
- [x] Enhanced badge endpoints to support OB3 in `src/routes/badges.routes.ts`
- [x] Updated assertion endpoints with OB3 format options in `src/routes/assertions.routes.ts`
- [x] Added verification endpoints for OB3 credentials in `src/routes/verification.routes.ts`
- [x] Created status list endpoints in `src/routes/status.routes.ts`
- [x] Implemented format conversion utilities for OB2 to OB3 transformation

### 6. Documentation ✅
- [x] Created OB3 specification documentation in `docs/OPEN_BADGES_3.md`
- [x] Updated API documentation for OB3 endpoints
- [x] Added example OB3 credential formats
- [x] Documented verification process for OB3 credentials
- [x] Added status list documentation and usage examples

### 7. Example Implementation ✅
- [x] Created end-to-end OB3 workflow example in `examples/ob3-workflow.ts`
- [x] Implemented key generation example
- [x] Added status list creation example
- [x] Created credential signing example
- [x] Added verification and revocation examples

## Technical Details

### Key Files and Components
- `src/models/credential.model.ts` - Core OB3 data models
- `src/constants/context-urls.ts` - JSON-LD context definitions
- `src/utils/signing/` - Cryptographic utilities
- `src/utils/schema-validation.ts` - OB3 schema validation
- `src/services/verification.service.ts` - Verification service
- `examples/ob3-workflow.ts` - End-to-end example

### Verification Flow
1. Credential signature is verified using the issuer's public key
2. Status is checked against the referenced status list
3. Structure is validated against OB3 schema requirements
4. Additional checks for required fields and credential validity

### Status List Implementation
- Uses compressed bit arrays following StatusList2021 specification
- Each credential is assigned a position in the status list
- Revocation status is encoded as a 1 (revoked) or 0 (valid)
- Status lists are themselves verifiable credentials with proofs

## Conclusion
The core Open Badges 3.0 implementation is complete and functional, with all essential components implemented. The system can issue, verify, and manage OB3 credentials using cryptographic proofs and status lists. Remaining tasks focus on testing, enhanced badge baking, and optional improvements.
