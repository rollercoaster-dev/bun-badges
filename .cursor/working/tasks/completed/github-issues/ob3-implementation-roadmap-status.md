# OB3 Implementation Roadmap Status

## Overview
This document tracks the status of the Open Badges 3.0 implementation, breaking down what has been completed and what remains to be done. The implementation follows the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model and extends the existing Open Badges 2.0 capabilities with cryptographic verification, DID-based identifiers, and enhanced privacy and security features.

## Core Implementation (✅ COMPLETED)

### 1. Data Models and Schema (✅ COMPLETED)
- [x] Enhanced credential models for Open Badges 3.0
- [x] Added full type definitions for VC data model
- [x] Implemented credential subject variations
- [x] Added status list credential types
- [x] Implemented proper JSON-LD context handling

### 2. Credential Generation (✅ COMPLETED)
- [x] Implemented OB3 credential creation
- [x] Added support for cryptographic signing
- [x] Implemented proper context inclusion
- [x] Added credential schema references
- [x] Created key generation utilities

### 3. Verification System (✅ COMPLETED)
- [x] Implemented cryptographic verification
- [x] Added support for signature validation
- [x] Created schema validation utilities
- [x] Implemented detailed verification results
- [x] Added tamper detection

### 4. Status List Implementation (✅ COMPLETED)
- [x] Implemented BitSet for status tracking
- [x] Created status list credential generation
- [x] Added UUID to index mapping
- [x] Implemented revocation mechanism
- [x] Created status update utilities

### 5. API Endpoints (✅ COMPLETED)
- [x] Enhanced badge endpoints to support OB3
- [x] Updated assertion endpoints with OB3 format
- [x] Added verification endpoints for OB3
- [x] Created status list endpoints
- [x] Implemented format conversion utilities

### 6. Basic Documentation (✅ COMPLETED)
- [x] Created OB3 specification documentation
- [x] Updated API documentation for OB3 endpoints
- [x] Added example OB3 credential formats
- [x] Documented verification process
- [x] Added status list documentation

### 7. Example Implementation (✅ COMPLETED)
- [x] Created end-to-end OB3 workflow example
- [x] Implemented key generation example
- [x] Added status list creation example
- [x] Created credential signing example
- [x] Added verification and revocation examples

## Remaining Work (❌ PENDING)

### 8. Testing Framework (❌ IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Create integration tests for OB3 workflows
- [ ] Implement schema validation tests
- [ ] Add cryptographic proof validation tests
- [ ] Create status list functionality tests
- [ ] Implement compliance testing against official examples

### 9. Enhanced Badge Baking (❌ PENDING)
- [ ] Enhance badge baking with OB3 support
- [ ] Add extraction capability for OB3 credentials
- [ ] Create validation for baked OB3 credentials
- [ ] Add tests for OB3 badge baking

### 10. Optional Enhancements (❌ PENDING)
- [ ] Implement additional cryptographic suites beyond Ed25519
- [ ] Add support for selective disclosure
- [ ] Enhance canonicalization for JSON-LD signatures
- [ ] Implement advanced privacy features

## Summary
- **Completed**: 7 major components (Core implementation)
- **Pending**: 3 components (Testing, Enhanced Badge Baking, Optional Enhancements)
- **Overall Progress**: ~70-80% complete

The Open Badges 3.0 implementation is functional and can issue, verify, and manage OB3 credentials, but lacks comprehensive testing and some enhanced features.

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize the implementation of integration tests for OB3 workflows
2. Complete the OB3 compliance E2E tests
3. Enhance badge baking for OB3 credentials
4. Consider implementing optional enhancements based on user needs
