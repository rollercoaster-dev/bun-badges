# Open Badges 3.0 Compliance E2E Tests

## Task Description
Create end-to-end tests to verify the application correctly implements the Open Badges 3.0 specification and properly validates compliance with the official 1EdTech standards.

## Priority
High

## Estimated Effort
8-12 hours

## Requirements

### 1. Core OB3 Technical Requirements
- Validate all issued badges follow the OB3 credential structure
- Verify cryptographic signatures are correctly applied and validated
- Confirm all required context URLs are included
- Test that credential schema references are properly included
- Validate proper handling of recipient identification methods
- Ensure status lists and revocation mechanisms function correctly
- Test credential verification across the full lifecycle

### 2. Test Organization
Create structured e2e tests in the following categories:

1. **Structural Tests**
   - Verify OB3 JSON-LD context URLs are correct
   - Confirm credential types include required values
   - Test credential schema references
   - Validate required fields on all objects

2. **Cryptographic Proof Tests**
   - Verify proper signing with EdDSA
   - Test proof verification
   - Validate tamper detection
   - Test verification of credentials with different proof types

3. **Status and Revocation Tests**
   - Test status list creation and verification
   - Verify revocation detection
   - Test status list updates
   - Validate revocation reason handling

4. **Recipient Identification Tests**
   - Test all supported identification methods
   - Verify proper hashing when enabled
   - Validate privacy preserving features

5. **Protocol Flow Tests**
   - Full lifecycle from badge creation to verification
   - Test against official OB3 examples
   - Verify JSON-LD validation
   - Schema validation tests

### 3. Official OB3 Compliance
- Create tests based on the official IMS Global conformance test suite
- Test against example badges from the OB3 specification
- Validate against the official OB3 schema files
- Use examples from the official documentation

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Test Environment**
   - Create dedicated test fixtures for OB3 testing
   - Set up isolated test database with OB3 schemas
   - Create test issuers with proper key configuration

2. **Build Core Test Fixtures**
   - Create reusable OB3 test data generators
   - Build verification utilities
   - Set up schema validation helpers

3. **Implement Test Suites**
   - Structural validation tests
   - Cryptographic proof tests
   - Status & revocation tests
   - Recipient identification tests
   - Full protocol flow tests

4. **Official Compliance Testing**
   - Implement tests based on IMS conformance suite
   - Create test cases matching official examples
   - Add schema validation with official schemas

5. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Create detailed documentation of test coverage
   - Build test report generation
   - Document findings and any gaps discovered

## Testing Approach

### Manual Testing Components
- Validation against external wallets
- Visual verification of credential display
- Compatibility with OB3 viewers

### Automated Test Components
- API response validation
- JSON schema verification
- Context URL validation
- Cryptographic proof testing
- Status list functionality

## Success Criteria
- All test cases pass consistently
- Issued credentials validate against official schemas
- Signatures are verifiable by external systems
- Full compatibility with OB3 specification
- All required fields and structures are present and valid

- [OB3 JSON-LD Context](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/context-3.0.3.json)
- [OB3 Schema Files](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/json/)
- [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
- [Status List 2021](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-list-2021/)

## Related Tasks
- Update context URL constants
- Implement schema validation
- Update cryptographic proof format

## Notes
- Consider running these tests in a separate suite due to their complexity
- May need to mock external context files for reliable testing
- Consider building a conformance reporting tool to track specification compliance status
