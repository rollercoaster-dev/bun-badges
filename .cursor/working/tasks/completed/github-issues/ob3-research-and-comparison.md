# Open Badges 3.0 Research and Comparison Task

## Task Description
Research the official Open Badges 3.0 specification and compare our current implementation status against it, identifying any gaps or improvements needed.

## Research Findings

After examining both the official Open Badges 3.0 specification and our current implementation, I've identified the following key findings:

### 1. Context and Serialization

**Official Requirement:**
- The Open Badges 3.0 context URLs should be:
  - `https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2`
  - `https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/context-3.0.3.json`
  - `https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/extensions.json` (for extensions)

**Our Implementation:**
- We're currently using:
  - `https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1`
  - `https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1`
  - `https://w3id.org/badges/v3`

**Gap:** Our context URLs need to be updated to the latest official URLs to ensure compatibility with other OB3 implementations and wallets.

### 2. Proof Format

**Official Requirement:**
- The specification supports two primary proof formats:
  - `DataIntegrityProof` with `eddsa-rdfc-2022` cryptosuite (preferred in newer implementations)
  - JWT-based proofs with `RSA256` algorithm

**Our Implementation:**
- We use `Ed25519Signature2020` for cryptographic proofs
- We have no support for JWT-based proofs

**Gap:** While our implementation is functional, we should update to the newer recommended proof format for better compatibility and certification.

### 3. Credential Schema

**Official Requirement:**
- Credentials should include a `credentialSchema` property with:
  - `id` pointing to the JSON schema URL (e.g., `https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/json/ob_v3p0_achievementcredential_schema.json`)
  - `type` set to `1EdTechJsonSchemaValidator2019`

**Our Implementation:**
- We don't currently include the `credentialSchema` property in our credentials

**Gap:** We need to add the schema reference to validate our credentials against the official schema.

### 4. Endorsement Support

**Official Requirement:**
- OB3.0 includes support for endorsements as specialized credentials that can endorse issuers, badge classes, or individual credentials
- These use the `EndorsementCredential` type

**Our Implementation:**
- No support for endorsement credentials

**Gap:** Implementation of endorsement functionality would enhance our offering, though it's not a core requirement.

### 5. Recipient Types

**Official Requirement:**
- Support for various recipient identifier types:
  - Email-based identity
  - DID-based identity
  - URL-based identity
  - Phone-based identity

**Our Implementation:**
- We have type definitions for these recipient types but limited actual support
- Our implementation focuses primarily on email and basic identity objects

**Gap:** Expand support for all recipient types, particularly DIDs for modern identity systems.

### 6. Status List Implementation

**Official Requirement:**
- Support for StatusList2021 for credential revocation

**Our Implementation:**
- We have a complete implementation of StatusList2021 for revocation
- Our bitstring encoding/decoding is properly implemented
- We correctly generate and verify status list credentials

**Strength:** This is an area where our implementation is strong and fully compliant.

### 7. Other Findings

**Validation:**
- We need to implement proper JSON-LD validation against the official schemas
- Our type guards are good but not sufficient for full compliance checking

**Miscellaneous:**
- Our API endpoints align well with the specification
- Our verification process follows the recommended flow but needs updates for new proof formats
- We don't have support for Terms of Use objects in credentials

## Next Steps

Based on these findings, I'm updating the implementation map to include a detailed breakdown of our compliance status and specific code changes needed. The primary improvements needed are:

1. Update context URLs to match the official specification
2. Add credential schema references to our credentials
3. Update our proof format to the newer recommended format
4. Implement endorsement support (medium priority)
5. Expand our recipient type support
6. Add validation against official JSON schemas

I recommend we focus first on context URLs and credential schema updates, as these are quick wins that would significantly improve our compliance level.

## Current Status Summary

Based on initial research, our implementation includes:

1. **Completed Features**
   - OB3.0 credential models with VC data model integration
   - Status list implementation for revocation
   - Cryptographic verification with Ed25519 signatures
   - Credential service for creating and signing OB3 credentials
   - Verification service with detailed results
   - Status routes for checking credential status
   - Documentation of OB3 features

2. **In Progress**
   - Integration tests for OB3.0 workflows

3. **Potential Gaps** (to be confirmed during research)
   - Full implementation of all recipient types
   - Complete alignment with latest context files
   - Support for selective disclosure
   - Multiple DID method support
   - Implementation of all optional extensions

## Risk Assessment
- Specification changes: Medium (OB3.0 is still evolving)
- Implementation complexity: Medium (cryptographic components require careful implementation)
- Compatibility issues: Low (we already support OB2.0 for backward compatibility)

## Success Criteria
- Complete documentation of our OB3.0 implementation status
- Clear understanding of compliance gaps
- Prioritized list of improvements needed
- Roadmap for achieving full specification compliance
