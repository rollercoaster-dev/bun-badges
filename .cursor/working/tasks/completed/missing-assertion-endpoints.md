# Missing Assertion Endpoints

## Issues

Tests show that assertion-related endpoints expected by our E2E test suite need to be properly implemented in the real application:

- POST /assertions - For creating badge assertions/issuances
- GET /assertions/:id - For retrieving a specific assertion
- GET /verify/:id - For verifying the validity of an assertion

## Required Implementation

1. Create or update the assertion router to handle:
   - POST /assertions - For issuing badges to recipients
   - GET /assertions/:id - For retrieving a specific badge assertion
   - GET /verify/:id - For verifying badge assertions

2. Ensure responses match expected formats:
   - Assertion creation should return status 201 with a JSON body including the id
   - Assertion retrieval should return status 200 with the assertion details
   - Verification should return status 200 with a "valid" boolean field

3. Implement proper validation and verification logic

## Acceptance Criteria

- E2E tests for assertion endpoints pass when running with real endpoints
- Assertions can be created, retrieved, and verified
- Proper validation and error handling is implemented
- Database integration works correctly for storing assertion information
