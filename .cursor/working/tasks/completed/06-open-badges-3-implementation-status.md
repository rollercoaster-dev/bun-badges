# Open Badges 3.0 Implementation Status

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of implementing Open Badges 3.0 in the Bun Badges application.
The implementation follows the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model and extends the existing Open
Badges 2.0 capabilities with cryptographic verification, DID-based identifiers, and enhanced 
privacy and security features.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed

- [x] Enhanced credential models for Open Badges 3.0
  - Added full type definitions for VC data model
  - Implemented credential subject variations
  - Added status list credential types

- [x] Implemented status list utilities
  - Created BitString encoding/decoding
  - Implemented credential revocation checks
  - Added UUID to index mapping

- [x] Enhanced credential service
  - Added support for creating and signing OB3.0 credentials
  - Implemented status list management
  - Improved verification with proof checking

- [x] Enhanced verification service
  - Added detailed verification results
  - Implemented status list verification
  - Improved error and warning reporting

- [x] Added status routes
  - Created endpoints for status list retrieval
  - Implemented credential status checking

- [x] Updated API documentation
  - Documented new endpoints and formats
  - Added example requests/responses for OB3 features
  - Updated error codes and verification details

- [x] Updated Open Badges 3.0 documentation
  - Added comprehensive technical details
  - Documented status list implementation
  - Added information about DID support and recipient types
  - Included reference links to standards

### In Progress

- [ ] Create integration tests for Open Badges 3.0 workflows
  - Test end-to-end issuance and verification
  - Test revocation via status lists
  - Test different recipient types

### Completed

- [x] Created migration for status list tables
  - Database schema for status lists is defined
  - Migration file is created with `db:migrate:status` command 

- [x] Added unit tests for new Open Badges 3.0 components
  - Created tests for status list utilities
  - Implemented tests for credential signing and verification
  - Test API endpoints still to be added

- [x] Created example script for OB3.0 workflow
  - End-to-end example from issuance to verification
  - Includes revocation via status lists
  - Demonstrates full badge lifecycle

- [ ] Implement additional cryptographic suites (optional)
  - Currently only Ed25519Signature2020 is implemented
  - Could add support for JsonWebSignature2020

- [ ] Enhance badge baking with Open Badges 3.0 support
  - Allow baking OB3.0 credentials into images
  - Add extraction capability for OB3.0 credentials

## Next Steps

1. Run database migrations for status list tables
2. Implement tests for new functionality
3. Create example scripts demonstrating OB3.0 workflows

## Technical Debt

- The current implementation uses a simplified status list approach
- Need to improve the canonicalization for JSON-LD signatures
- Future consideration: Add support for selective disclosure capabilities
