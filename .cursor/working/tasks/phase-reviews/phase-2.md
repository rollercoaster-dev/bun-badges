# Phase 2: Core Infrastructure & Database Setup Review

## Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist
1.  **Database Connection Module:**
    *   [`✅`] Reusable module exists (`src/services/db.service.ts`, `src/db/config.ts`).
    *   [`✅`] Uses configured driver (`drizzle-orm`/`pg`).
    *   [`✅`] Connection details loaded securely from env vars (`DATABASE_URL`).
    *   [`✅`] Connection successful (verified via CI tests).
2.  **Database Migration Tool Setup:**
    *   [`✅`] Migration tool integrated (`drizzle-kit`).
    *   [`✅`] Tool configuration exists (`drizzle.config.ts`).
    *   [`✅`] Migration scripts exist (`drizzle/` directory).
    *   [`✅`] `package.json` scripts exist (`db:migrate`, `db:push`, etc.).
    *   [`✅`] Migrations run successfully (verified via CI).
3.  **Structured Logging Implementation:**
    *   [`✅`] Structured logging library integrated (`src/utils/logger.ts` - now using **Pino**).
    *   [`✅`] Hono request logging middleware implemented (`hono/logger` in `src/index.ts`).
    *   [`✅`] Log level configurable via env vars (`LOG_LEVEL` in `src/utils/logger.ts`).
    *   [`✅`] Logs are structured (e.g., JSON). *Gap Resolved: Now using Pino, which outputs JSON by default in production.*
4.  **Global Error Handling Framework:**
    *   [`✅`] Custom error classes exist (`src/utils/errors.ts`).
    *   [`✅`] Global Hono error handling middleware exists (`src/middleware/error-handler.ts`).
    *   [`✅`] Errors logged appropriately (stack traces, no sensitive data) via logger utility.
    *   [`✅`] Standardized JSON error responses returned (`{ error: message }`).
5.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   [`✅`] README explains DB setup, migrations, env vars (`DATABASE_URL`, `LOG_LEVEL`).
    *   [`~`] Standardized error response format documented. *Minor Gap: Not explicit in README, assumed covered by Swagger docs at `/docs`.*

## Current Implementation Status & Analysis
*   Phase 2 infrastructure is largely complete and functional.
*   Database connection (Drizzle/pg), migrations (Drizzle Kit), and global error handling (custom errors, Hono middleware) are well-implemented.
*   **Logging now uses Pino**, configured for JSON output in production and pretty-printing in dev/test, resolving the previous gap.
*   Documentation covers DB setup/migrations/env vars in README.
*   **Relevant Files/Dirs:** `src/services/db.service.ts`, `src/db/config.ts`, `drizzle.config.ts`, `drizzle/`, `src/utils/logger.ts`, `src/middleware/error-handler.ts`, `src/utils/errors.ts`, `README.md`, `package.json`.
*   **Comparison to Benchmark:** Strong alignment. The switch to Pino aligns logger output with benchmark recommendations.

---

## Gap Analysis (vs. Benchmark)
*   ~~**Logger Output Format:** The custom logger in `src/utils/logger.ts` outputs human-readable, colorized text to the console, not machine-parsable structured JSON format (like Pino). While functional for development, JSON is preferred for production log aggregation/analysis.~~ **RESOLVED by switching to Pino.**
*   **(Minor) Error Format Documentation:** The standardized error response format (`{ error: message }`) is not explicitly documented in the main `README.md`. It is assumed to be covered by the Swagger API documentation available at `/docs`.

---

## Required Improvements / Actionable Tasks
1.  ~~**(Optional/Consideration)** Refactor `src/utils/logger.ts` or replace it with a library like Pino to output structured JSON logs, especially when `NODE_ENV` is `production`. Maintain console-friendly output for development if desired.~~ **DONE.**
2.  **(Optional/Minor)** Add a brief section to `README.md` describing the standard JSON error response format (`{ error: message }`), complementing the existing Swagger documentation.

### Key Commit Points (per branch)
*   **Branch: `feat/security-middleware`**
    *   Commit 1: `refactor(logger): replace custom logger with pino` (`12bc263`)
*   **Branch: `docs/add-error-format-readme`**
    *   Commit 1: `docs(readme): add section describing standard error response format`

### Potential Pull Request(s)
*   PR #43 (Includes logger refactor)
*   `(New PR)` `docs: Add error response format documentation to README` (If README update is done)

## Learnings from Phase 2 Implementation & Refinement

*   **Benchmark Value:** The benchmark's focus on structured logging proved relevant, as the initial review correctly identified the need to move away from the custom console logger for better production observability.
*   **Refactoring Scope:** Replacing core utilities like logging requires careful, systematic updates across numerous files (controllers, services, utils, tests), highlighting the interconnectedness of the codebase.
*   **Verification Importance:** Automated checks (`tsc`, `lint`, `test`) were critical during refactoring to catch integration issues and regressions early.
*   **Tooling Nuances:** Automated code editing tools significantly sped up the process but occasionally required multiple attempts or manual intervention for complex files, emphasizing the need for oversight.
*   **Standard Libraries:** Switching to a standard library (Pino) for logging addressed the identified gap effectively and aligns the codebase better with common production practices and features (e.g., JSON output, redaction).
