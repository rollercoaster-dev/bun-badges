# Phase 3: Security Implementation Review

## Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist (Based on Benchmark Plan)
1.  **Authentication Strategy Implemented:**
    *   [`~`] Chosen strategy (API Keys, JWT, OAuth2) implemented. *(Current: JWT Bearer, but conflicts with Rule 005: OAuth 2.0)*
    *   [`~`] Middleware exists to validate credentials (`src/middleware/auth.ts`, `src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts` - **REDUNDANT**).
    *   [`~`] Secure storage/handling of primary secrets (e.g., API key hashes, JWT secret). *(Uses `JWT_SECRET` from env var - handling needs verification)*.
2.  **Authorization Strategy Implemented:**
    *   [`✅`] Middleware exists for authorization if needed (RBAC implemented in `src/middleware/auth.ts` - `requireRole`, `requireOwnership`).
3.  **Secure Key Loading Implemented (for OB 3.0):**
    *   [`❌`] Functions exist to securely load issuer private keys based on chosen strategy (Vault, Secrets Mgr, encrypted DB, etc.). **MAJOR GAP.**
    *   [`❌`] Keys are not exposed in logs or errors. *(No implementation found)*.
4.  **Auth Middleware Applied:**
    *   [`?`] Relevant Hono routes are protected by AuthN/AuthZ middleware. *(Needs verification by checking route definitions)*.
5.  **Testing:**
    *   [`❌`] Unit tests for key loading logic (mocking secret stores), JWT validation/signing. *(No specific tests found)*.
    *   [`~`] Integration tests for AuthN/AuthZ middleware (valid/invalid credentials, permissions), protected endpoints. *(Some likely exist but need review for completeness)*.
6.  **Documentation:**
    *   [`~`] README/API Docs explain authentication. *(Needs update based on consolidated/chosen strategy)*.
    *   [`❌`] Key management procedures documented for operators.
    *   [`~`] Security Model document updated. *(Needs creation/update)*.

## Current Implementation Status & Analysis
*   The project has a basic authentication system implemented using JWT tokens, with middleware for protecting routes.
*   Security headers are implemented using Hono's built-in `secureHeaders` middleware.
*   CORS is configured using Hono's `cors` middleware.
*   The JWT implementation includes token generation, verification, and revocation mechanisms.
*   There appears to be a database-backed token revocation system, but the in-memory implementation is still present.
*   The authentication system supports different token types (access, refresh, registration, verification).
*   There is no clear role-based authorization system implemented yet.
*   Secure key management for issuer private keys is not evident in the examined code.
*   **Relevant Files/Dirs:** `src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`, `src/utils/auth/jwt.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `src/services/db.service.ts`
*   **Comparison to Benchmark:** The implementation partially meets the Phase 3 benchmark. Basic authentication is in place, but role-based authorization, secure key management, and comprehensive security headers need further development.

---

## Gap Analysis (vs. Benchmark)
*   **Role-Based Authorization:** The current implementation lacks a comprehensive role/permission-based access control system. This is a significant gap as it limits the ability to provide granular access control to different API endpoints.
*   **Secure Key Management:** There is no evident mechanism for securely loading and managing issuer private keys, which is critical for Open Badges 3.0 implementation.
*   **JWT Secret Management:** The JWT secret is currently loaded from an environment variable with a hardcoded fallback, which is not ideal for production environments.
*   **Token Revocation:** While there is a token revocation mechanism, it appears to use both an in-memory store and a database approach, which could lead to inconsistencies.
*   **Input Validation:** While the codebase likely uses Zod for validation in some areas, a comprehensive input validation strategy across all endpoints is not evident.
*   **Security Documentation:** Documentation about the authentication process, key management, and security model appears to be missing or incomplete.
