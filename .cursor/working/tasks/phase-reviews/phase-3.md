## Current Implementation Status & Analysis
*   The project has a basic authentication system implemented using JWT tokens, with middleware for protecting routes.
*   Security headers are implemented using Hono's built-in `secureHeaders` middleware.
*   CORS is configured using Hono's `cors` middleware.
*   The JWT implementation includes token generation, verification, and revocation mechanisms.
*   There appears to be a database-backed token revocation system, but the in-memory implementation is still present.
*   The authentication system supports different token types (access, refresh, registration, verification).
*   There is no clear role-based authorization system implemented yet.
*   Secure key management for issuer private keys is not evident in the examined code.
*   **Relevant Files/Dirs:** `src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`, `src/utils/auth/jwt.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `src/services/db.service.ts`
*   **Comparison to Benchmark:** The implementation partially meets the Phase 3 benchmark. Basic authentication is in place, but role-based authorization, secure key management, and comprehensive security headers need further development.

---

## Gap Analysis (vs. Benchmark)
*   **Role-Based Authorization:** The current implementation lacks a comprehensive role/permission-based access control system. This is a significant gap as it limits the ability to provide granular access control to different API endpoints.
*   **Secure Key Management:** There is no evident mechanism for securely loading and managing issuer private keys, which is critical for Open Badges 3.0 implementation.
*   **JWT Secret Management:** The JWT secret is currently loaded from an environment variable with a hardcoded fallback, which is not ideal for production environments.
*   **Token Revocation:** While there is a token revocation mechanism, it appears to use both an in-memory store and a database approach, which could lead to inconsistencies.
*   **Input Validation:** While the codebase likely uses Zod for validation in some areas, a comprehensive input validation strategy across all endpoints is not evident.
*   **Security Documentation:** Documentation about the authentication process, key management, and security model appears to be missing or incomplete.

## Required Improvements / Actionable Tasks
1.  **Implement Role-Based Authorization:**
    * Create a permission/role model in `src/models/auth/`
    * Implement role checking in the authorization middleware
    * Update database schema to store user roles and permissions
2.  **Enhance Secure Key Management:**
    * Implement a secure key loading mechanism for issuer private keys
    * Add key rotation capabilities
    * Ensure keys are protected in logs and error messages
3.  **Improve JWT Security:**
    * Move JWT secret to a more secure storage mechanism
    * Implement proper secret rotation
    * Enhance token validation with additional checks
4.  **Consolidate Token Revocation:**
    * Migrate fully to database-backed token revocation
    * Remove the in-memory implementation
    * Add tests for token revocation scenarios
5.  **Enhance Input Validation:**
    * Create comprehensive Zod schemas for all API endpoints
    * Implement middleware for request validation
    * Add sanitization for user inputs
6.  **Improve Security Documentation:**
    * Document authentication process in README
    * Create key management procedures documentation
    * Update security model with implementation details
