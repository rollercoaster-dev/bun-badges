# BitSet Docker Compatibility Issue

## Problem Summary
- The application uses `fast-bitset` for credential status lists in Open Badges 3.0
- The `fast-bitset` module appears incompatible with Bun in a Docker environment
- This causes a `ReferenceError: BitSet is not defined` error during container startup
- Primary usage is in `src/utils/signing/status-list.ts` for bit manipulation

## Solution Implemented: Custom BitSet Implementation
We implemented a custom BitSet class that provides the same functionality as fast-bitset but is fully compatible with Bun. This approach was chosen because it offers:

- Complete control over the implementation
- No dependency issues with external modules
- Tailored to our exact use case
- No module resolution or global variable problems in Bun

## Changes Made
1. Created a native implementation of BitSet in `src/utils/bitset.ts`
2. Updated imports in `status-list.ts` to use our custom implementation
3. Removed BitSet-specific code from the compatibility module
4. Simplified the Docker build process by removing BitSet patching
5. Updated the verification script to test the application with our custom implementation

## Verification
- [x] Docker image builds without errors
- [x] Application starts correctly in the container
- [x] Health endpoint responds correctly
- [x] No runtime errors related to BitSet
- [x] Simplified Docker build process

## Benefits
- More reliable Docker builds
- Simplified codebase without complex workarounds
- Better maintainability by removing external dependencies
- Full compatibility with Bun runtime
- Smaller Docker image (no extra patches needed)

## Future Considerations
- Monitor the performance of our custom BitSet implementation compared to fast-bitset
- Add comprehensive unit tests for the custom BitSet implementation
- Consider contributing our improvements back to the community if applicable
