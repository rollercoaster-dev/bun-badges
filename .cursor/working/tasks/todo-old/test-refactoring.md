# Test Refactoring Project

## Objective
Refactor the test suite to use the new controller-based architecture and improve test organization.

## Progress
- [x] Created test utilities for OB2 and OB3 assertions
- [x] Updated assertions integration tests to use new controller
- [x] Updated verification integration tests to use new controller
- [x] Updated verification edge case tests to use new controller
- [x] Fixed type errors in test files
- [x] Added proper type definitions for test responses
- [x] Improved test organization and readability
- [x] Added test cases for missing required fields
- [x] Added test cases for invalid field values
- [x] Added test cases for edge cases in both OB2 and OB3 formats

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add test cases for credential status list verification
- [ ] Add test cases for proof verification
- [ ] Add test cases for revocation verification
- [ ] Add test cases for expiration verification
- [ ] Add test cases for mixed context versions
- [ ] Add test cases for malformed JSON
- [ ] Add test cases for invalid signatures
- [ ] Add test cases for invalid proof types
- [ ] Add test cases for future-dated revocation
- [ ] Add test cases for credential schema validation

## Current Status
- Tests passing: 29/50 (58%)
- Coverage: 75%
- Linting: All errors fixed
- Type safety: Improved with proper type definitions

## Notes
- The test suite now uses a more modular approach with separate test utilities for OB2 and OB3 formats
- Edge cases are properly tested for both formats
- Type safety has been improved with proper interfaces and type assertions
- Test organization follows a clear pattern: basic functionality, edge cases, and error cases
- Each test file focuses on a specific aspect of the system
- Test utilities are now properly typed and documented
