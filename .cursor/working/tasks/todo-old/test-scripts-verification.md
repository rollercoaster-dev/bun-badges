## Test Scripts Verification Status

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Reorganized test scripts into `tests/scripts/` directory
- [x] Updated paths in test scripts to reflect new directory structure
- [x] Made all shell scripts executable
- [x] Verified unit tests script (`test-unit.sh`) works
- [x] Verified integration tests script (`test-integration.sh`) works
- [x] Verified E2E tests script (`test-e2e.sh`) infrastructure works
  - Database setup successful
  - Migrations run successfully
  - Script executes correctly
  - Note: No test files found in tests/e2e directory
- [x] Fixed and verified test-file script works
  - Updated paths to use SCRIPT_DIR
  - Successfully runs both unit and integration tests
  - Properly handles database setup/teardown

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Create E2E test directory and sample test
- [ ] Verify test-all script (`test-all.sh`)
- [ ] Document any script-specific requirements or dependencies
- [ ] Update package.json scripts if needed

### Script Status
- `test-unit.sh`: ‚úÖ Working
- `test-integration.sh`: ‚úÖ Working
- `test-e2e.sh`: ‚ö†Ô∏è Script works but needs test files
- `test-all.sh`: üîÑ Needs verification
- `test-file.sh`: ‚úÖ Working

### Next Steps
1. Create `tests/e2e` directory and add a sample test
2. Run test-all script to ensure it properly orchestrates all test types
3. Document any issues found and create fixes

### Notes
- Integration tests are showing some failures but the script itself is working correctly
- E2E test script infrastructure works but needs test files
- Need to ensure all scripts handle database setup/teardown properly
- Consider adding error handling for missing dependencies

### Current Issues
1. E2E tests:
   - Script looking for tests in `tests/e2e` but directory doesn't exist
   - Need to create directory and add sample test file
   - Current search path: `src/tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts`
