# Task: Expand Test Coverage for Open Badges Implementation

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:** Enhance the test coverage of the codebase by adding more integration tests, edge case tests, and e2e tests
- **Energy Level:** Medium ðŸ”‹
- **Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours

## 2. Resources
- **Existing Files to Examine:**
  - `.cursor/working/tasks/completed/test_organization.md` - Test organization guidelines
  - `src/services/__tests__/integration/` - Existing integration tests
  - `src/__tests__/` - Unit tests directory
  - `test-integration.sh` - Integration test runner
  - `src/utils/test/db-helpers.ts` - Test database helpers

- **Additional Context:**
  - Recent work has reorganized tests to separate unit and integration tests
  - Some redundant unit tests have been removed in favor of integration tests
  - Missing e2e tests for the complete badge lifecycle
  - Edge cases and error handling need more test coverage

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### 3.1 Create End-to-End Test Suite
- [ ] Create a new directory for e2e tests (`tests/e2e/`)
- [ ] Implement badge lifecycle e2e test (create issuer â†’ create badge â†’ issue badge â†’ verify badge)
- [ ] Implement e2e tests for badge baking and extraction
- [ ] Add e2e test for badge verification workflow
- [ ] Create e2e test for revocation and status checking

### 3.2 Enhance Integration Tests
- [ ] Add missing integration tests for OAuth flows
- [ ] Improve error case coverage in existing integration tests
- [ ] Add integration tests for badge management API
- [ ] Create integration tests for issuer management features
- [ ] Implement integration tests for badge baking and extraction

### 3.3 Add Edge Case Tests
- [ ] Create test suite for boundary conditions (e.g., validation limits)
- [ ] Add tests for invalid input handling
- [ ] Test error responses for all API endpoints
- [ ] Add tests for concurrent operations
- [ ] Create timing-related tests (expiration, token validity)

### 3.4 Implement Security Tests
- [ ] Add tests for authorization checks
- [ ] Create tests for permission validation
- [ ] Implement tests for token security
- [ ] Add tests for data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Create tests for secure API access

### 3.5 Improve Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Enhance test data seeding for different scenarios
- [ ] Create test factory functions for generating test data
- [ ] Implement test isolation improvements
- [ ] Add test database reset capabilities
- [ ] Create test documentation

## 4. Success Criteria
- [ ] Test coverage increased to at least 80% of codebase
- [ ] All core badge lifecycle operations have e2e tests
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are thoroughly tested
- [ ] Security and authorization tests verify access control
- [ ] Test documentation clearly explains testing strategy

## 6. Notes
- Focus on integration and e2e tests rather than adding more unit tests
- Consider using test factories to reduce test code duplication
- Add appropriate test data cleanup to prevent test pollution
- Document test organization strategy for future contributors
