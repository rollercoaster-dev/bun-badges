# Task: Integrate Improvements from Fork (../fork-bun-badges)

This task involves reviewing changes from the forked repository, comparing them with the current codebase, and integrating beneficial changes onto separate feature branches.

**Branching Strategy:** Create a new branch for each logical group, starting from the current base branch (assuming `main`). Commit changes following the `010_git_convention.mdc`.

**Notes:**
- Ensure each branch starts from the main development branch.
- Use `cat ../fork-bun-badges/<path>` to view forked file content.
- Apply changes carefully, using `edit_file` for modifications and creations.
- Commit messages should follow the convention: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
