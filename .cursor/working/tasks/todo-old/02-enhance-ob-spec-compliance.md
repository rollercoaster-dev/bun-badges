# Task: Enhance Open Badges Specification Compliance

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:** Improve compliance with the Open Badges 3.0 specification by implementing missing features and fixing inconsistencies
- **Energy Level:** High ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹
- **Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started
- **Priority:** High
- **Estimated Time:** 10-12 hours

## 2. Resources
- **Existing Files to Examine:**
  - `src/models/credential.model.ts` - Core credential models
  - `src/services/credential.service.ts` - Credential creation and validation
  - `src/services/verification.service.ts` - Verification logic
  - `src/utils/badge-baker.ts` - Badge baking implementation
  - `src/routes/assertions.routes.ts` - Badge assertion routes

- **Reference Documentation:**
  - [Open Badges 3.0 Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/)
  - [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
  - [JSON-LD 1.1 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/)

- **Additional Context:**
  - Current implementation has partial OB3.0 support but is missing key features
  - Better JSON-LD context handling is needed
  - Endorsements and revocation status features are incomplete

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### 3.1 Improve JSON-LD Context Handling
- [ ] Enhance the `@context` handling in credential creation
- [ ] Implement proper JSON-LD context validation in verification
- [ ] Create utility functions for context expansion/compaction

### 3.2 Add Support for Endorsements
- [ ] Define endorsement model in `credential.model.ts`
- [ ] Implement endorsement creation in `credential.service.ts`
- [ ] Add endorsement verification to `verification.service.ts`
- [ ] Create API endpoints for endorsement management

### 3.3 Enhance Credential Status Features
- [ ] Implement `credentialStatus` property for OB3.0 assertions
- [ ] Add support for RevocationList2020 status type
- [ ] Implement status list credential generation
- [ ] Update verification to check credential status

### 3.4 Improve Alignment and Evidence
- [ ] Enhance alignment object model for educational standards
- [ ] Improve evidence modeling and validation
- [ ] Add support for multiple evidence items
- [ ] Implement evidence verification

### 3.5 Implement Verification Method Types
- [ ] Add support for additional signature types beyond Ed25519
- [ ] Implement JWS validation for credentials
- [ ] Add support for Linked Data Proofs
- [ ] Create proof verification for multiple proof types

## 4. Success Criteria
- [ ] The implementation passes validation against the OB3.0 specification tests
- [ ] JSON-LD contexts are properly handled and validated
- [ ] Endorsements can be created, verified, and displayed
- [ ] Credential status is properly implemented and verified
- [ ] Multiple proof types are supported and verified
- [ ] Evidence and alignment features are fully implemented

## 6. Notes
- This task focuses on specification compliance, not performance or security
- Some features might require database schema updates
- Consider creating a comprehensive test suite for spec compliance
- Document all implementation decisions for future reference
