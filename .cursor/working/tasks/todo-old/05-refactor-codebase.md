# Task: Refactor Open Badges Codebase for Maintainability

## 1. Goal
- **Objective:** Improve the maintainability and readability of the codebase through strategic refactoring
- **Energy Level:** High ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹
- **Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours

## 2. Resources
- **Existing Files to Examine:**
  - `src/services/` - Service implementations with overlapping concerns
  - `src/controllers/` - Controllers with potential refactoring opportunities
  - `src/utils/` - Utility functions that could be reorganized
  - `src/db/schema/` - Database schemas with circular dependencies
  - `src/routes/` - API routes with complex handlers

- **Additional Context:**
  - Circular dependencies have been partially addressed
  - Error handling is inconsistent across the codebase
  - Some functions are too large and have multiple responsibilities
  - Dependency injection is not used, making testing more difficult
  - Configuration is scattered throughout the codebase

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### 3.1 Refactor Service Layer
- [ ] Implement dependency injection for services
- [ ] Split large service methods into smaller, focused functions
- [ ] Extract common functionality into shared utilities
- [ ] Standardize error handling across services
- [ ] Improve service interface definitions

### 3.2 Reorganize Utility Functions
- [ ] Group related utility functions into logical modules
- [ ] Create a consistent error handling utility
- [ ] Refactor validation functions for reusability
- [ ] Implement a centralized logging strategy
- [ ] Extract configuration into a dedicated module

### 3.3 Fix Circular Dependencies
- [ ] Complete the resolution of circular dependencies in schema files
- [ ] Reorganize imports to prevent circular references
- [ ] Implement a module structure that prevents cycles
- [ ] Document the module dependency graph
- [ ] Create guidelines for preventing future circular dependencies

### 3.4 Improve Controllers and Routes
- [ ] Separate route definitions from handlers
- [ ] Extract validation into middleware
- [ ] Standardize response formats across all routes
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling in controllers
- [ ] Reduce duplication in controller logic

### 3.5 Database Layer Improvements
- [ ] Create a consistent pattern for database operations
- [ ] Implement proper transaction handling
- [ ] Improve connection pool management
- [ ] Extract complex queries into named functions
- [ ] Add proper error handling for database operations

## 4. Success Criteria
- [ ] No circular dependencies in the codebase
- [ ] Consistent error handling throughout the application
- [ ] Smaller, more focused functions with single responsibilities
- [ ] Dependency injection used for services
- [ ] Improved testability of components
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns across modules

## 6. Notes
- Focus on maintainability and readability, not premature optimization
- Make incremental changes with tests to verify behavior is preserved
- Document architectural decisions in comments or dedicated documentation
- Consider using a linter or static analysis tool to catch potential issues
